# discord-random-text-gen
A Discord Bot for generating random text.

## How to Host the Bot (LOCAL)

Create a bot folder and open the Windows CMD in it. Type `npm install discord.js --save`. This will install Discord.JS into your bot folder. Make sure you have Node.JS installed on your computer. If you don't, install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Copy app.js into a code editor of your choice. I would recommend Atom, because it is easy to use and is fully customizable. Edit app.js to fulfill your needs. I've added comments to lines of code that you can edit. Make sure you replace `bot.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);`
